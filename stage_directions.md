## Example of Stage Directions in Context

```
(Lights up on a cluttered apartment. JANE sits at her desk, staring at a blank computer screen.)

JANE: (sighing) I just can't find the words today.

(The doorbell rings. She jumps, startled.)

JANE: Who could that be?

(She crosses to the door and opens it. MARK stands in the doorway, soaking wet.)

MARK: (breathlessly) I ran all the way here.

JANE: (confused) But why would you—

MARK: (interrupting) Because I had to tell you something.

(A long pause as they stare at each other. Thunder rumbles outside.)
